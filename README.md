##  Key Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Cleaned and visualized features such as department, tenure, and job satisfaction to identify emerging patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived new metrics (e.g., tenure brackets, satisfaction categories) that added clarity to analytical insights.
- **Decision Tree Modeling**: Built a model to predict attrition risk, achieving approximately 83% accuracy; key model interpretation highlighted contributing factors like work-life balance and overtime.
- **Visualization & Reporting**: Created plots and visual summaries that illuminated insights for stakeholders, such as high-turnover departments and engagement factors.
